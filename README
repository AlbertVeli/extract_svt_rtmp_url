This script is a quick hack to extract the rtmp url from a svtplay stream.

If you got here via a search engine you are probably lost and
should instead use one of these:

 http://svtget.se/ (https://github.com/mmn/svtget)
 http://pirateplay.se/ (https://github.com/jackuess/pirateplay)

Svtget has a more potent script and pirateplay supports several sites.
This one only extracts the highest bitrate (2400 kbps) stream and, if
succesful, prints out a command that hypothetically could be used to
download that stream.

I wrote this because the svtget bash script didn't work on mac osx.
Probably because osx uses another version of sed (and bash). For
portability's sake this script uses a more universal sed syntax
that works out on both mac osx, GNU/Linux and maybe the local gym too.
It is also written in the ancient bourne shell syntax in order to
be compatible with all (if not more) *nix dialects.

I do not encourage anyone to download streams from svtplay. But if
you decide to go wild and crazy and do it anyway it might be a good
idea to read The Disclaimer Below first.


The Disclaimer Below

It is legal to download streams from svtplay for private use as
long as you pay the Radiotjänst TV-avgift. But you may NOT re-distribute
these inspelningar to someone who doesn't pay the Radiotjänst TV-avgift.
If you do you may be infringing brottskod 5101 (which just happens to
be worse than terrorism).
